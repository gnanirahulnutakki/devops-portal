**Steps**:

1. Click **Repository Browser** in the left sidebar
2. Select a repository from the dropdown (e.g., `rli-use2`)
3. Select a branch from the branch dropdown (e.g., `rli-use2-mp02`)
4. Browse the file tree to find your file (e.g., `app/charts/radiantone/values.yaml`)
5. Click on the file to view its contents in the Monaco editor

**Tip**: Use the search functionality in dropdowns to quickly find repositories or branches by typing part of the name.

---

### Task 2: Editing a Configuration File on a Single Branch

**Goal**: Update a configuration value for one environment

**Steps**:

1. Navigate to the file using Repository Browser (see Task 1)
2. Click the **Edit** button
3. Make your changes in the Monaco editor
   - Syntax highlighting will help identify errors
   - YAML validation runs automatically
4. Review your changes
5. Scroll down to the commit section
6. Enter a meaningful commit message:
   ```
   Update FID version to 8.1.2 for mp02 environment
   ```
7. Click **Commit Changes**
8. Wait for the success confirmation

**What Happens Next**:
- The file is updated on the selected branch
- A commit is created in GitHub with your message
- The change appears in the audit log
- ArgoCD will detect the change and sync automatically (if configured)

---

### Task 3: Bulk Update Across Multiple Branches

**Goal**: Update the same configuration value across 50+ tenant branches simultaneously

**Use Case**: You need to update the FID version from 8.1.1 to 8.1.2 across all production tenants.

**Steps**:

1. Click **Bulk Operations** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Bulk Operation** button
3. Fill in the operation details:
   - **Repository**: Select `rli-use2`
   - **Branches**: Select target branches (use Select All or pick specific ones)
   - **File Path**: `app/charts/radiantone/values.yaml`
   - **Operation Type**: Choose "Field Update" or "Full File Replace"

4. **For Field Update**:
   - **Field Path**: `fid.image.tag`
   - **New Value**: `"8.1.2"`
   - **Commit Message**: `Update FID version to 8.1.2`

5. **Preview** your changes:
   - The system will show you what will change in each branch
   - Review the diff for a few branches to ensure correctness

6. Click **Execute Bulk Operation**

7. Monitor progress:
   - You'll see a progress bar showing completion percentage
   - Real-time updates for each branch (Success/Failed/In Progress)
   - Estimated time remaining

8. Review results:
   - Once complete, review the summary
   - Check for any failed branches
   - Retry failed operations if needed

**Time Saved**: What used to take 4-6 hours now takes 10-15 minutes!

## Best Practices

### Configuration Management

1. **Always Use Meaningful Commit Messages**
   - ‚úÖ Good: `Update FID version to 8.1.2 for security patch CVE-2024-1234`
   - ‚ùå Bad: `update`

2. **Preview Before Committing**
   - Always review your changes in the diff view
   - Check YAML syntax is valid
   - Ensure no accidental changes

3. **Test on One Branch First**
   - Before bulk operations, test on a single dev/qa branch
   - Verify the change works as expected
   - Then roll out to production branches

### Pull Request Workflow

1. **Use Feature Branches for Significant Changes**
   - Don't commit directly to master for major updates
   - Create a feature branch
   - Get peer review through PR

2. **Write Descriptive PR Descriptions**
   - Explain what changed and why
   - Include testing steps
   - Add any relevant context

3. **Keep PRs Focused**
   - One PR should address one concern
   - Avoid mixing unrelated changes

### Bulk Operations

1. **Select Branches Carefully**
   - Double-check you've selected the right branches
   - Use branch filtering to avoid accidents

2. **Use Field Updates When Possible**
   - Field updates are safer than full file replacement
   - Only the specified field changes
   - Other values remain untouched

3. **Monitor Progress**
   - Don't close the browser during bulk operations
   - Watch for any failures
   - Retry failed branches after investigating

### Safety

1. **Be Careful with Protected Branches**
   - Master/main branches may have protections
   - Follow your team's process for these branches

2. **Keep Audit Trail**
   - All changes are logged
   - Use meaningful descriptions
   - This helps with troubleshooting and compliance

## Tips and Tricks

### Keyboard Shortcuts (Monaco Editor)

- **Ctrl/Cmd + F**: Find in file
- **Ctrl/Cmd + H**: Find and replace
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Z**: Undo
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z**: Redo
- **Ctrl/Cmd + /**: Comment/uncomment line
- **Alt + Up/Down**: Move line up/down
- **Shift + Alt + Down**: Duplicate line
- **Ctrl/Cmd + D**: Select next occurrence of word

### Quick Navigation

- Use browser search (Ctrl/Cmd + F) to find repositories or branches in dropdowns
- Bookmark frequently accessed pages
- Use browser back/forward buttons to navigate between views

### Bulk Operations

- **Save Common Branch Sets**: You can save frequently used branch selections for future operations
- **Schedule Operations**: For large-scale updates, run during off-peak hours
- **Parallel Execution**: The system handles 10 branches concurrently for speed

### File Editing

- **Auto-Completion**: Start typing in YAML files and press Ctrl+Space for suggestions
- **Syntax Validation**: Red squiggles indicate YAML errors - hover for details
- **Indentation**: Use spaces, not tabs for YAML files (Monaco auto-formats)

### Pull Requests

- **@mention Team Members**: Use @username in PR comments to notify specific people
- **Link Issues**: Reference issue numbers with # (e.g., #123) to link related issues
- **Templates**: Your team can create PR templates for consistent descriptions
