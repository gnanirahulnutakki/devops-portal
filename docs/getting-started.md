## Your First Task: Updating a Configuration

### Scenario: Update FID version for a QA environment

**Step 1: Navigate to Repository Browser**
- Click "Repository Browser" in the left sidebar
- Or click "Edit Config" button from Home

**Step 2: Select Your Target**
- **Repository**: Select `rlqa-usw2` from dropdown
- **Branch**: Select `rlqa-usw2-qa01` (or your target environment)
- **File**: Select `values.yaml`

**Step 3: Edit the Configuration**
- Click "Edit with Monaco" button
- The Monaco editor will open with your file
- You have two editing modes:
  - **Field-Level Edit**: Update specific YAML fields
  - **Full File Edit**: Edit the entire file

**Step 4: Using Field-Level Edit (Recommended)**
- Select "Field-Level Edit" tab
- In the field selector:
  - **Field Path**: `fid.image.tag`
  - **New Value**: `v1.2.3`
- **Commit Message**: `Update FID to v1.2.3 for QA`

**Step 5: Choose Branches (Optional for Multi-Branch)**
- If updating multiple environments:
  - Check additional branches (e.g., `rlqa-usw2-qa02`, `rlqa-usw2-qa03`)
- Or keep just the current branch selected

**Step 6: Commit Changes**
- Click dropdown arrow next to commit button
- Choose one option:
  - **Commit to Current Branch**: Direct commit
  - **Commit to New Branch**: Create feature branch
  - **Create New Branch & Pull Request**: Create branch + PR

**Step 7: Verify Changes**
- If you created a PR, go to "Pull Requests" tab
- View the diff to confirm changes
- If you committed directly, check ArgoCD for deployment

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Quick Single-Environment Update
```
1. Repository Browser ‚Üí Select repo/branch/file
2. Edit with Monaco ‚Üí Field-Level Edit
3. Update single field
4. Commit to current branch
5. Done! ArgoCD will auto-deploy
```

### Workflow 2: Bulk Update Across Environments
```
1. Repository Browser ‚Üí Select base branch
2. Edit with Monaco ‚Üí Field-Level Edit
3. Update field (e.g., fid.image.tag ‚Üí v1.2.3)
4. Select multiple branches (15 QA branches)
5. Commit ‚Üí "Update Field in 15 Branches"
6. Go to Operations tab to track progress
7. View Audit Log for results
```

### Workflow 3: PR-Based Deployment
```
1. Repository Browser ‚Üí Select branch
2. Edit with Monaco
3. Make changes
4. "Create New Branch & Pull Request"
5. Fill PR title and description
6. Create PR
7. Go to Pull Requests tab
8. Review changes
9. Merge when ready
10. ArgoCD deploys automatically
```

## Understanding Branch Selection in Monaco Editor

When editing with Monaco:

### Single Branch Mode
- Edit and commit to current branch only
- Fastest for single environment updates

### Multi-Branch Mode
- Select multiple branches from checkboxes
- First 15 branches shown
- Click "View All X Branches" to see and select all
- Selected branches have:
  - Navy blue background
  - Checkmark icon
  - Bold text

### Branch Selection Dialog
- Search for branches by name
- Check/uncheck branches
- See total selected count
- Click "Done" to confirm

## Key Concepts

### Field Path Notation
YAML paths use dot notation:
```yaml
fid:
  image:
    tag: v1.2.3
```
Field path: `fid.image.tag`

### Branch Naming Convention
- `{product}-{region}-{customer}`
- Example: `rlqa-usw2-customer01`
- Production branches are protected

### Bulk Operations
- Asynchronous processing
- Returns Operation ID
- Track progress in Operations tab
- View results in Audit Log

### Commit Messages
Best practices:
- Be descriptive: "Update FID to v1.2.3 for QA environments"
- Include ticket number: "JIRA-123: Fix memory leak"
- Avoid generic: "update" or "fix"

## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Use Field-Level Edits When Possible
- Safer than full file edits
- Clear intent
- Easy to review
- Less merge conflicts

### 2. Preview Changes Before Committing
- Review diff carefully
- Check all selected branches
- Verify commit message

### 3. Use Pull Requests for Production
- Always use PRs for production changes
- Get peer review
- Document changes in PR description

### 4. Monitor Operations
- Check Operations tab for bulk operations
- View Audit Log for history
- Watch ArgoCD for deployment status

### 5. Test in Lower Environments First
- Test in dev/qa before prod
- Verify configuration works
- Roll out incrementally

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics:

1. **Try a test update** in a dev environment
2. **Explore the Pull Requests tab** to see existing PRs
3. **Check the Operations tab** to see bulk operations
4. **Review the Audit Log** to see change history
5. **Read the detailed guides** for specific workflows
